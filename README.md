## Make sharing fast and secure.

While it's very easy to copy-and-paste scripts to embed a tweet or Facebook share button, you end up slowing down your site by loading resources from multiple servers. Also, these scripts violate privacy by tracking users even if they don't wish to use them. The good news is that social networks provide a way to share content through special URLs, which socialshares uses to give a lightweight and consistently-designed solution.

## ðŸš€ socialshares is getting a revamp!

There hasn't been an update to socialshares in a while, and that is because we're working hard on v2! Setup and customization will be much simpler with a single script tag, and the buttons will have a slightly refined design. If you're excited, you can check out the progress on the [v2-dev branch](https://github.com/socialshares/buttons/tree/v2-dev).
